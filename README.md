- Hi, I’m @hrztn
- I’m interested in anything related to making an idea a reality XD
- I’m currently learning front-end development, I already covered the basics for App Dev and Web Dev. 
* App Dev: Only Android application sadly, IDE used is Android Studio, plus I have learned to use Firebase as its backend.
* Web Dev: I have knowledge on the basics which is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- My goals is to become a full stack developer, but I recognised that it is not an easy task. Therefore, I'll be using github as a tool to improve myself, track my progress, and publish projects that I'll do in the future.
- I plan to create an online portfolio so that people could contact me or access/view my projects. For now, here is my email hrztan99@gmail.com
