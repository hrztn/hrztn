- Hi, Iâ€™m @hrztn
- I'm presently learning front-end development, having already covered the fundamentals of App Dev and Web Dev.
* App Development: I've only created application for Android platform, and the IDE I'm using is Android Studio. I've also learned how to use Firebase as a backend.
* Web Development: I am familiar with the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- My ambition is to become a full stack developer, but I acknowledge that this will not be a simple process. As a result, I'll be utilising github as a tool to help me develop myself, document my progress, and publish projects that I'll be working on in the future.
- I intend to develop an online portfolio via which people will be able to contact me and access/view my projects. For the time being, please contact me through hrztan99@gmail.com.
